<p>Rovaniemi is a city located 6kilometers south of the Artic Circle and is in between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korlkalovaara. It is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finlands northmost provinces.Since Rovaniemi is the capital of the region of Lapland, many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the University of Lapland but also the Lapland University of Applied Sciences (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, forestry, rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the Lapin Kansa, Uusi Rovaniemi and Lappilainen.
